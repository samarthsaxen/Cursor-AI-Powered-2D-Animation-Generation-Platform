Cursor – AI-Powered 2D Animation Generation Platform

Cursor is a full-stack AI-driven platform that converts text or code prompts into 2D educational animations, cutting manual content creation time by up to 70%.
The system leverages Manim (Python) for animation generation and integrates an LLM-powered backend for intelligent script inference and automation.

🚀 Features

🧠 AI-powered animation creation from text/code prompts

🎬 2D animation rendering engine using Python Manim library

🌐 Full-stack architecture: React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

🔗 10+ RESTful API endpoints for inference, animation handling, and asset retrieval

💾 MongoDB for storing scripts, user data, and animation sequences

💻 Responsive UI built with React.js, Bootstrap, and custom CSS

🧩 LLM-based logic generation for text-to-scene translation

⚡ Optimized backend pipelines for scalability and speed

🔒 Secure API design with modular backend structure

⚙️ Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/samarthsaxen/Cursor-AI-Powered-2D-Animation-Generation-Platform
cd Cursor

2️⃣ Setup Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start

3️⃣ Setup Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev

4️⃣ Setup Python AI Engine
cd ../ai_engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
python animation_builder.py

💡 Example Usage

Prompt Example:

"Create an animation showing the difference between acceleration on Earth and the Moon."


AI Process:
The LLM generates a Manim scene script

The Python engine renders a 2D animation

The result is displayed or downloaded via frontend

📊 Results & Impact
